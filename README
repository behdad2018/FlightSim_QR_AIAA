You should dowload all of the codes in your working directory. The simulink flight simulation model
is "M_6DoF_BS_Full_backup_11_25_2018.slx" and the simulation can be managed/initialized using 
"Main_run.m" including the geometry/characterstics of quad-copter.

Through "M_6DoF_BS_Full_backup_11_25_2018.slx", you can choose your desired wind model (No wind, LES or Dryden).
Also you can choose your desired trajectory as well the aerodynamic model. Please download this paper to know more about
the capabalities built into this flight simulation module:
